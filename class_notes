4/25
assignment 3 due 5/10 at midnight. extension of system in ass2 to work on many files instead of one.
class presentation due end of class, data science paper analysis. 5-minute overview of paper in presentation
    present virtually or in class
acl- proceedings on comp ling, many peer reviewed
jml can help too
class: type or category of object found within  hierarchy
instantiating a class: Constructor with a creator such as collections.OrderedDict(), which is assigned to a var
    might use parameters or assume default values
classes have attributes including vars and methods
    accessed w/dot operator
it is expected of devs to know how to read the documentation
absolute path: exact location of file
relative path specifies location of a file relative to folder currently being worked in
dir path: no filename at the end, opp file path
manipulating paths in python: pathlib module
    instantiate path object from path class
mac/linux: PosixPath result
path.glob: will find files and directories in path that match a certain pattern
can use a list comprehension to only get files; glob naturally returns a generator
files = [x for x in p.glob...]
    do this in terminal, as a list comprehension
    if x.is_file(), add in
*.docx or *.txt: will add all of some file type
metrics: for evaluating NLP systems
    accuracy, precision, recall
        acc = correct/total
        precision: true pos/all pos
        precision is small SD
        recall: true pos/true pos plus false neg
        accuracy paradox: remember stats, type 1/2 errors
    precision may be more important than recall or accuracy (or some other order) in some cases
    precision and recall can be useful if looking at a particular class of reviews/files
bias-variance tradeoff
error analysis needed to be manual work with domain expertise. this helps with automation facilitation.
for final presentation, discuss either what error analysis has been done and what could have been done
    if you notice errors, run the errors yourself
